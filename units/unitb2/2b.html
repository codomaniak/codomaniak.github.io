					<p class="dialogue">Ireland now has one of the best education systems in the world. Class sizes are small, exam results are good and most children are happy to stay at school after the minimum leaving age of sixteen. It is easy to forget

					<p class="dialogue">For years, Ireland had one of the most complicated education systems in the world. There were many different kinds of school, but most of them had a lot in common. Classes were large and the teaching was very
						traditional. As in many
						countries, teachers used to hit the children if they made mistakes (the government banned corporal punishment in 1982).</p>

					<p class="dialogue">Parents used to pay for their children's education and, as a result, there were schools for the rich and schools for the poor. Boys and girls went to different schools and studied different subjects. Nowadays, most
						schools are free and
						only about half the schools are single-sex. In many ways, education is now a woman's world. Girls do better than boys in their exams, more girls go to university and most teachers are women.

					<p class="dialogue">At the end of secondary school, students take their final exams (the `Leaving Certificate'). Compulsory subjects are maths, history, Irish and a foreign language. In addition, they must choose two or three extra
						subjects. Some of these.
