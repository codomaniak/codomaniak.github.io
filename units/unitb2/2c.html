					<h4>Teacher talk www.teacher-taik.com</h4>
					<p>Doug 20 April</p>
					<p class="dialogue">In October last year, I was working at a school in Cambridge and it was only my second month in the job. At the end of the month the head teacher organized a party for all the new teachers. It was a good chance to get to
						know my new colleagues and I was really looking forward to it. As the party was on 31st October, I thought it was a Hallowe'en party. So, the day before the party, I went to a costume hire shop and got a witch's costume. When I arrived at
						the head's
						house, he opened the door and looked at me as if I was completely mad. All the other teachers were wearing normal clothes!</p>

					<p>Tamsin 26 April</p>
					<p class="dialogue"> It was the end of term in June and the students were doing their exams. I was in charge that day and, as usual before the start of the exam. I told the students all the rules: no talking, no mobile phones and so on. I
						was walking up and down between the rows of desks when suddenly my own phone rang. That was bad enough, but the phone had a really silly ring tone. It took me ages to find the phone in my bag and my face went bright red. One of the
						students
						was laughing so much that she fell out of her chair.</p>

					<p>Kelly 3 May</p>
					<p class="dialogue">Worst moment? It was one day last May. When I woke up in the morning, I wasn't feeling very well. But it was a beautiful day and I decided to go to school. In the first class I gave the students an exercise to do and sat
						down at my desk.
						It was hot and the sun was coming through the window and I fell asleep. I probably slept for only two or three minutes. Then I heard a noise and I woke up. All the children were laughing and the headmaster was standing at the door of the
						class! Fortunately, he was very sympathetic later in the morning when I explained that I was feeling ill.</p>

					<h4>Read the information about Trinity College in Dublin.</h4>
					<p class="dialogue"> Trinity College, Dublin, became the first Irish university when it opened in 1594. All the students studied the same subjects - Latin, Greek, mathematics, science and philosophy. In 1834, the university allowed students
						to study
						specialized subjects. Eight years later, the university opened a department of engineering. In 1925, the first students entered the university's business school. At the beginning, Trinity College was only for Protestants. The first
						Catholic students arrived two hundred years later. Many famous writers studied at Trinity. Jonathan Swift (who wrote Gulliver's Travels) and Bram Stoker (who wrote Dracula) both went there. The first women did not enter Trinity College
						until 1904. Mary Robinson, who became the first woman Irish president in 1990, studied law at Trinity in the 1960s. </p>
