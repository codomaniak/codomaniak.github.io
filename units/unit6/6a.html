					<p class="half">After fen years together, Kyie and Sue finally got married last Saturday. They didn't want a big wedding; they got married in the town hall (not very romantic, in my opinion). I didnâ€™t go to the ceremony, but I went to the
						party on
						Saturday night. It was in an Indian restaurant in the city centre. I met somebody at the party. His name is Julian, and he and Kyle are friends from university.
