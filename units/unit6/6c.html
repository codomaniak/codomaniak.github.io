					<h4>Read the article. Choose the best title: Men never cry / Crying-it's a man's thing / Crying - good for your health / Men and sports</h4>
					<p>Men don't cry, or do they? British psychologists and researchers say that men cry easily, more easily than we think. One in three British men cry once a month, and in America, men cry on average 1.4 times a month.</p>
					<p>Why do men cry more now? In Britain and America it is more acceptable for men to cry today. Two recent US presidents, Bill Clinton and George W Bush, cried quietly on television in front of millions of people.
						Football star David Beckham cried when be took his children lo school the first time. And British Olympic athiete Matthew Pinsent cried when he won a gold medal at the Athens Olympics m 2004.</p>
					<p>In a survey on crying, men said that they often cry when they are sad or when they feel bad. They said they don't cry when they are angry. But men cry a lot more than women when they are happy. For example, many British men cry when
						their
						favourite football team plays very well and wins a cup.</p>
					<p>Doctors say that crying is good for your body. Most people say that they usually feel better after crying. So the next time you want to cry, go ahead. It's good for you!</p>
