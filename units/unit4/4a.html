					<p>Will Cotton works in an office in New York. He goes to work at 7:30. He starts work at
						8:15. He usually finishes work at 6:00, but has meetings after work. After his meetings
						he goes to the gym, or has a drink with friends in the cafe. He gets home at 9:00 and has dinner. He goes to bed at 12:15 am. It's a very busy day. How does he do it?</p>
					<p>'Easy', says Will, 'At 4:30 I go to MetroNaps.'
						MetroNaps is a company in New York. At MetroNaps you get into a machine called the MetroNap pod. You listen to quiet, relaxing music and then go to sleep. After twenty minutes, the pod moves with music and light and you wake up.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>MetroNaps also has a cafe, and there are sandwiches and drinks for you after your nap.</p>
					<p>Will likes MetroNaps. ‘I get my best ideas in bed, not at a desk’, - says Will. ‘When I go to work after a nap, I'm relaxed. I'm not stressed in meetings after work. I do more with my day.'</p>
					<p>The MetroNaps offices are in the Empire State Building in New York.
						It's open from 10:00 to 6:00. It's a very quiet place.</p>
