					<h4>Read the magazine article.</h4>
					<h4>Who would you like as a neighbour?</h4>
					<p>A recent opinion poll asked 1,000 people in Britain this question. The winner of the poll was the TV celebrity, model and pop singer, Cheryl Cole, with 31% of the vote.</p>
					<p>Many people in Britain know very little about their neighbours, but they often know a lot about the lives of TV celebrities, especially those on reality TV shows. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>The British public obviously think they know a lot about Cheryl Cole, who has been a judge on the reality TV show, The X Factor. But Cheryl Cole does not, perhaps, want to live close to her fans. Her last home was a huge mansion in the
						country with no neighbours. Now, she travels many times a year between homes in London and the United States, and she tries to keep her address a seacret.</p>
					<p>The top man in the poll was the TV chef, Jamie Oliver. Oliver lives in the fashionable district of Primrose Hill, in north London, with his wife and children. </p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>It is a quiet and beautiful residential area, five minutes from one of London's best parks. His neighbours include film stars like Jude Law and Ewan McGregor, the supermodel Kate Moss, as well as politicians and bankers. Neighbours
						describe Oliver as a friendly, helpful neighbour ... but no one asks him to
						help with the cooking!</p>
					<p>The British like attractive TV personalities and cooking, but, it seems, they do not want to live next door to politicians. There was not a single politician in the top twenty names.</p>
				</section>

					<h4> Put the information in the correct order. </h4>
