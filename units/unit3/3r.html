					<h4>Read the letter</h4>
					<p>Dear Bob and Madge,</p>
					<p>Welcome to my home. I hope you have a nice stay for the weeks you are here. Here is some useful information about the house and the town. Crawford is a nice small town. There are some good shops but there isn't a cinema or theatre. There
						is a beautiful park near to the river. The river is about 15 minutes from my house. There is a small shop on the street. My house, number 15, is opposite the shop and next to a school. Don't worry, in the holiday the school is closed so it
						is quiet.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>OK, inside the house. There are three rooms on the ground floor the kitchen, a living room and a small room at the back with the washing machine. There are some plants in the kitchen next to the fridge. Please water them. The TV is on
						the
						table next to the bookcase in the living room. There are two bedrooms on the first floor. Please use the one opposite the bathroom. In the study - next to the bathroom - there is a computer and a small stereo with my CDs.</p>
					<p>So, enjoy your stay.</p>
					<p>Malcolm</p>
